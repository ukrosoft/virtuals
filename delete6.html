                    If you need more specialized help in different fields, we will look together for a customized plan
                    in order to build your team.
                    Before you start working with your VA or OBM, you will have a meeting with him/her to see if he/she
                    responds to your expectations.

                    Your dedicated online business manager or VA will take care of all your tasks and report you
                    consistently.
                    At the beginning of our cooperation, we provide you the right tools to maximize communication and
                    efficiency.
                    We'll help you get started by facilitating a launch meeting so you can orientate your assistant to
                    your work and the tasks you want completed.
                    You will always be able to keep track of what tasks your assistant is performing and how long it's
                    taking in your user-friendly Client Dashboard. We recommend that you over-communicate in the
                    beginning to set the stage, and be as available as possible to answer questions. Please refer to our
                    new client guide for tips on how to make the most of your new partnership.
